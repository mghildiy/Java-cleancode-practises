This project is an attempt to put together various coding practises recommended in various programming books, online blogs,
online programming tutorials etc.

Hints from unit tests:
    Don't pass unnecessary data to a method.
    Avoid primitive obsession. Prefer to wrap primitives in object when they are to be passed around.
    Don't mutate input objects in a method, else it makes mocks stubbing in unit tests too complex.Prefer pure functions.
